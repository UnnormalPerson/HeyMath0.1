#Removed the import numpy line as it was not being used in the code.
#Fixed the syntax error on line 16 by removing the unnecessary round function call. The line now reads: gradient = grady / gradx.
#Added a missing closing parenthesis on line 22 for the print statement.
#Removed the exec statement on line 26, which was unnecessary.
#Added a missing closing parenthesis on line 27 for the input statement.
#Now the code checks if gradx is zero before calculating the gradient. If gradx is zero, it prints an error message stating that the gradient cannot be calculated.
